          <h5>Minas Morgul</h5>
          <p>
            "Minas Morgul" is the second full-length album by the Austrian black
            metal band Summoning. The band and many of their fans consider this
            album to be their debut album as it developed the "Summoning sound"
            and brought the band to a larger audience due to its lyrics
            involving J. R. R. Tolkien's themes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The album received dominantly positive reviews. It was criticized
            for the vocals and Kraftwerk-esque drum sound, but was praised for
            its context referencing Tolkien. Sputnik describes the band's sound
            as bombastic and unique because the synths provide medieval sounds,
            giving it an amazing result when fused with guitars. Metal Storm
            considers the album as one of the most appreciated black metal
            releases.

          <h5>Dol Guldur</h5>
          <p>
            "Dol Guldur" is the third studio album by the Austrian black metal
            band Summoning. It was released in 1997, through Napalm Records.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            All lyrics are written by P. K. of the black metal band Abigor apart
            from those by J. R. R. Tolkien, who is even credited in the album
            booklet. The final track, "Over Old Hills", is based on the song
            "Trapped and Scared" from Protector's solo project, Ice Ages' debut
            album "Strike the Ground". The album's cover was adapted from
            'Middle Earth', a painting by Roger Garland, and from a picture of
            the Ottenstein reservoir in the Austrian Waldviertel, showing the
            ruins of Lichtenfels Castle.

          <h5>Stronghold</h5>
          <p>
            "Stronghold" is the fourth full-length album by the Austrian black
            metal band Summoning. This album marked a change in the sound of
            Summoning as it was much more "guitar orientated with more compact
            keyboard-melodies". "Where Hope and Daylight Die" features Tania
            Borsky, Protector's ex-girlfriend and a former member of Die
            Verbannten Kinder Evas, on lead vocals. The album's cover was
            adapted from 'The Bard', an 1817 painting by John Martin.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This album is the first by Summoning to feature audio-clips; the
            clips used on this album were from the movies Braveheart and Legend.

          <h5>Lost Tales</h5>
          <p>
            "Lost Tales" is the second EP by Summoning. It consists of two
            dungeon synth songs: "Arcenstone", that was originally written for
            the darkwave project of Silenius called "Mirkwood" (which was never
            released), and "Saruman", a song left over from the "Dol Guldur"
            sessions in 1996.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The songs are not in high quality and just taken from the original
            tape were they have been recorded. Originally there were two other
            cover layouts, which they wanted to use, but didn't get the
            permission by the painter's distributer.
